# Anvil for macOS

A minimal GUI application to help you install and manage multiple macOS apps in batches using Homebrew. Organize your preferred app groups and streamline macOS app setup with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.

**Prefer the command line?** Use the [Anvil CLI](https://github.com/rocajuanma/anvil) instead.

## Installation

1. Download the latest [Anvil DMG](https://github.com/rocajuanma/anvil-app/releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG file
3. Drag **Anvil.app** to the **Applications** folder
4. Launch from Applications

## Troubleshooting

### "Anvil cannot be opened" or malware warning

This is normal for unsigned apps. To open:

1. **Right-click** (or Control+Click) on **Anvil.app**
2. Select **"Open"** from the menu
3. Click **"Open"** in the dialog

macOS will remember your choice. This is a one-time step.

**Alternative:** Go to **System Settings** → **Privacy & Security** → Click **"Open Anyway"**
